## Reflection

This was a 1 day long project built during my preparation for my web page. Project goals included using vite to create the react frame.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are Vite,React, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the

 'create vite@latest' 

boilerplate to minimize initial setup.

Icons used are 'fontawesome'

Option 2 & 3 will follow, then I will choose one of them for the final page project.
